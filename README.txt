nQueens
Author: Michael Wilcox

Background:
This program was written as part of an assignment for a class in Algorithm Design. 

Problem:
For info on the general 8-Queens problem, see the wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle
This program is generalized for 'n' queens on an nxn board.

Timeval:
The timeval functions are used to track the runtime of the program, and was specifically included for time complexity analysis for the assignment. They were not written by me. All other code is my own.
